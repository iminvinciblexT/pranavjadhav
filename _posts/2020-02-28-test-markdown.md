As the term states:
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, abbreviated for OCD is a commonly termed state of mind wherein a person gets entangled into certain obsessions or compulsions with respect to daily habits.

<hr/>

[WHO](https://www.who.int/) had ranked OCD to be one of the [top 10 handicapping conditions](https://www.bmj.com/content/348/bmj.g2183) due to loss of income or decreased quality of life. With approximately 
OCD has been pretty common in all age groups but is predominantly observed in younger people. 

**Obsessions** can be related to the constant and ever persisting unwanted thoughts that would keep looping through your mind. 
**Compulsions** are the constant repetitive actions that a person would tend to do for overcoming anxiety and thoughts.

**Note:** Some extreme compulsions can take obsessions to a worse state!

Being also ranked as the fourth most common mental disorder, do we still need to figure out the judgemental pass of the state itself?
Undoubtedly, obsessive compulsions are a way of life and can seemingly be termed as the ethics in routine on a constant and deeper level. And meanwhile, recognition of this state into a list of disorders is considerably creating a negative sense over itself.

<hr/>

Some aspects of obsessive compulsions can indeed be extremely helpful in the context of leading to a disciplined way of life. Yes, past a certain extent, things can get worse and the situation might indeed require medical/psychological help. 

But, if you ever come across a person with a controlled state of obsessive compulsion, that person might just teach you things you never thought of. This might include general behavioural improvements and an improved way of lifestyle as well. Believe me or not, such a controlled person will provide the best presentation skills in all aspects. They are definitely the ones who think, the ones who can be careful before even small appearances, the ones who can keep things visually so extremely intact that you might never have thought of.

Not to sound biased but in accordance with my own way of perceptions, it sometimes seems to be discriminative to have such terms of disorders. And why? Because extremity of any behavioural adaption can be a curse in itself which we don't necessarily think as a disorder. 

Considering a person who can be shy or introverted into his/her own way, such discriminative statements can be more disastrous in order to make the condition deteriorate and lead to over-obsessive behavioural tendencies.
So, if you yourself or someone around are into the situation of obsessive compulsions and feel the need for medical attention, it would be recommended to consult one. [Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)](https://www.babcp.com/public/What-is-CBT.aspx) is probably one of the most effectively termed solutions for the same.
